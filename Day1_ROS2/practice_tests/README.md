**Issue**: Custom messages not recognized
**Solution**: Understand message compilation process

### 4. Coordinate System Confusion
**Issue**: Incorrect robot movement calculations
**Solution**: Review coordinate system fundamentals

### 5. System Integration Complexity
**Issue**: Difficulty combining multiple components
**Solution**: Start simple and build incrementally

## Tips for Success

### Before Starting
1. Review all module READMEs and quickstart guides
2. Ensure all example code runs correctly
3. Practice with ROS2 command-line tools
4. Understand agricultural context for each module

### During Tests
1. Read questions carefully
2. Start with easier exercises first
3. Test code incrementally
4. Use logging for debugging
5. Comment your code clearly

### Time Management
- **Knowledge Quiz**: 30 seconds per question average

**Answer**: B) Service/Client (for synchronous request-response)

### Coding Exercise Sample
**Task**: Create a node that publishes soil moisture readings every 2 seconds with values between 0-100%.

**Expected Output**:
```python
# Should create a publisher on topic /soil_moisture
# Should publish Float64 messages with realistic values
# Should include proper error handling and logging
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **ROS2 not sourced**: Run `source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash`
2. **Python path issues**: Use `python3` explicitly
3. **Node communication failures**: Check topic names and types
4. **Permission errors**: Ensure files are executable
